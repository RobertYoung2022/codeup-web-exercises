<h1>10 National Parks</h1>

<dl>
    <dt>Great Smoky Mountains</dt>
    <dd>Coming in at the top spot with a whopping 12.1 million visits, Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the
        country's most-visited national park. Crossing North Carolina and Tennessee, this park is known for its
        wildlife, waterfalls, and fog-covered mountains. It's worth visiting year-round for scenic views and outdoor
        activities like hiking, but the park really shines in autumn, when its trees put on a vibrant display of red,
        orange, and gold foliage.

    <dt>Yellowstone National Park</dt>
    <dd>The world's first national park, Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872, and in 2020, it recorded 3.8
        million visits. Throughout its 2.2 million acres, visitors can find a range of unique hydrothermal attractions,
        including Mammoth Hot Springs, Old Faithful geyser, and Grand Prismatic Spring, as well as waterfalls, lakes,
        and wildlife.
    </dd>
    <br>
    <dt>Zion National Park</dt>
    <dd>Utah is home to some of the country's best national parks, including Arches, Bryce Canyon, and Canyonlands, but
        Utah's first — and most popular — national park is Zion National Park. Dramatic cliffs and canyons shape this
        impressive landscape, and visitors can enjoy hiking, climbing, biking, birding, and stargazing during their time
        here.
    </dd>
    <br>
    <dt>Rocky Mountain National Park</dt>
    <dd>Covering 415 mountainous square miles, Rocky Mountain National Park is the fourth most-visited. Here, visitors
        can spot a variety of wildlife, including elk, bighorn sheep, moose, bats, and many others (all from a safe
        distance, of course), and explore the park's many hiking trails. Rocky Mountain National Park also has a number
        of scenic drives for visitors who want to see the park's alpine forests, wildflower-covered meadows, and more
        without leaving their cars.
    </dd>
    <br>
    <dt>Grand Teton National Park</dt>
    <dd>The jagged peaks of the incredible Teton Range tower above Grand Teton National Park, the second Wyoming park to
        make the list. (Consider visiting Grand Teton and Yellowstone in one road trip.) Incredible mountains meet
        alpine lakes and lush valleys at this national park, where visitors can enjoy mountaineering, hiking, boating,
        and fishing. Keep an eye out for bison, elk, beavers, moose, and more wildlife when you visit.
    </dd>
    <br>
    <dt>Grand Canyon National Park</dt>
    <dd>Often referred to as one of the world's natural wonders, the immense Grand Canyon is a breathtaking sight, so
        it's no surprise that Grand Canyon National Park is the one of the country's most-visited national parks.
        Visitors can spend their days here hiking along the canyon's walls, rafting down the Colorado River, taking in
        the views on a scenic car or train ride, and learning about Native American culture and history.
    </dd>
    <br>

    <dd>Located between Cleveland and Akron, Ohio, Cuyahoga Valley National Park offers plenty to see and do, including
        hiking, biking, canoeing, kayaking, golfing, and fishing. Explore the Towpath Trail following the historic route
        of the Ohio and Erie Canal, or hop aboard the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad to watch the scenery (and wildlife
        like eagles, deer, beavers, and otters) pass by.
    </dd>
    <br>
    <dt>Acadia National Park</dt>

        Harbor.
    </dd>

    <dt>Olympic National Park</dt>
    <dd>Over in the Pacific Northwest, Olympic National Park draws millions of visitors each year. Within its nearly one
        million acres of park land, visitors will find a number of unique landscapes and ecosystems to explore, like
        temperate rain forests, a rocky Pacific coastline, and high mountain peaks, including Mount Olympus. Stargazing,
        hiking, boating, and more are among the park's popular activities.

    <dt>Joshua Tree National Park</dt>

        Sky Park, so it's the perfect place to go stargazing).
